     a gripping romance of indian war and pioneer life in kentucky

on the banks of the elkhorn river  not far from frankfort  stand what is
left of two rough stone chimneys  in a still thriving cornfield  a
century and more ago these were the chimneys of the log cabin which ezra
todd and his groomsmen built for his bride  polly 

it was furnished in those days  the one room and lean to of it  with
stout puncheon tables and stools  also the handicraft of his groomsmen 
with a bed made in the pioneer fashion  a forked branch supporting a
pole whose other end stuck into a chink of the logs  a second pole
crossing it transversely  and this framework covered by a straw filled
tick and a fine  thick feather bed  for polly came to her husband with a
fair plenishing  there was a spinning wheel  too  and a hooded cradle
stood beside the high backed settle at the hearth  and the board
shelves  laid on pegs stuck into the walls  held good earthenware
dishes  and even some plates and cups and candlesticks of shining
pewter 

at the back was a batten door  thickly studded in nails  that had
peepholes on either side  high and low  there was a musket in a rack
behind the door  and a flintlock rifle hung beneath the high  paneless
window  whose solid wooden shutter  with two small apertures in it 
opened inward  it seemed to ezra todd  on a particular afternoon early
in the past century  as pleasant and as safe a home as man ever prepared
reluctantly to leave for the uncertainties and discomforts of kentucky
travel 

his wife waited upon him in silence  a lithe  graceful girl  almost wild
in her movements  and barefoot  although dressed otherwise rather finely
for a frontier woman  in a sprigged bedgown or overdress  cambric frills
to her sleeves and cap  his eyes followed her lovingly  a little
anxiously  as she brought him his belt  tied it behind over his fringed
leather hunting shirt  handed him the long knife and tomahawk to place
in it  and lastly the red handkerchief to bind about his forehead in
place of a cap  it was too warm for caps 

they do say  he remarked  that master ames in harrodsburg has got
some new sort of cap in his store  made neither of fur nor hide  but of
fine light fabric  we grow foppish  what say  polly mine  shall i return
to you tricked out in fancy headgear with a feather in it  like the
fellow in the song folks are singing nowadays  he smiled at her as he
sang gaily  yankee doodle  bow wow wow  yankee doodle dandy    

granny estill looked up quickly from her knitting  a gray  bent
creature  twisted with rheumatism  older than women are nowadays at her
age  yet with the youthful  laughing eyes of a girl 

what a pretty  gay tune it is  she said  tapping her foot and humming
after him  i do like to hear a new tune now and then  be sure you bring
me one from the town  ezra 

he laughed kindly  eh  youve the gay heart  and the dancing foot
still  ill be bound  spite of the rheumatics  i wouldnt trust you at a
wedding or a roof raising  thank you  my love  he added  as polly 
still in silence  handed him his musket  now the bullet pouch  though i
protest it goes against my nature to have you always waiting on me so 
for all the world like one of those savage females    

granny interrupted  let be  a woman likes to wait on her man  son 
especially so fine and proper and upstanding a man as you 

he chuckled  tis easy to see how  you  managed to capture four
husbands for yourself  mistress estill  but i did not marry a wife to be
a servant to me  i buy my servants  he added  proudly  or at least i
shall be buying them as i sell the crops  here in this rough life you
women have your full share of the work  without mollycoddling an
able bodied husband into the bargain  i cannot make of our polly a fine
lady  not yet  but i can keep her from wearing herself to the bone in
service of mine  look how thin she is growing  it shames me  granny  can
you not make her mind her food  ive been watching her the past few
days  and i declare she does not eat enough to keep a robin alive 

tis true she eats too little  but no man can say that of your son 
ezra  nursing mothers are always thin  be they dog  or cat  or mare  you
know that  it may be she is wise to start him on the bottle  though i do
not hold with these newfangled notions myself 

ezras face softened tenderly  polly must do as she thinks best
there  though a nursing mother should have special reasons for learning
to eat  he waited a moment for polly to speak  but as she did not do
so  he murmured to her in a lower voice  barefoot again  do you not
like the pretty shoon i had the cobbler make to your measure  the
buckles are of pure silver  lass  i had them from a french trader 

                                                    

polly looked at her feet in embarrassment  trying to hide one with the
other  and spoke for the first time 

i  i forgot  her voice was musical  but shy and hesitating  as if she
had not the habit of using it 

ah  let be  said granny again  protectively  tis cruel to try to
make a child into a woman all at once  dearie me  how well i mind that i
used to slip away to play with my wooden doll baby weeks after i wore
the cap and shawl myself  till my husband caught me and teased me out of
it  because a live one was coming  polly has had so little childhood 
poor lamb  she was but ten when they took her  remember  and for that
matter  tis a comfort sometimes to feet more broke to shoon than
pollys to be free of the cramp of sole leather   she glanced down
comically at her own 

if you spoil her so  frowned ezra  if you encourage her wild ways 
how am i ever to make a staid and proper matron of my wife 

grannys eyes twinkled  are you so sure you want her to be a staid and
proper matron  isnt a sweetheart better 

 illustration  in the doorway stood a tall young chieftain  wearing a
bonnet of gray eagles feathers  a stately  splendid young creature  the
girl sat by the cradle  head bowed  

but the mans face did not relax  look what happened on the day of the
christening  when the neighbors came in from near and far  did they find
the young mother in her rightful place in the chimney settle  dressed in
the quilted paduasoy petticoat my mother brought over the mountains 
they did not  they found her paddling the stream  her kirtle tucked up
to her bare knees  her hair unbound like a maidens  dipping the babe in
the water and him as naked as a newborn pig  what a sight for
god fearing folk on the sabbath day 

granny chuckled aloud  and ezra laughed too  a little reluctantly  as he
could not help himself 

oh  i dare say it was a pretty enough sight  but what conduct for young
mistress todd  matron of a years standing  mother of a son  wife of one
of the coming men of the country  ahem  he strutted a little  boyishly 
his eye on polly  trying to make her smile  but she did not smile 
perhaps  he added  sobering  it was the indian form of christening but
we are not savages 

granny put a quick  warning finger to her lips  and ezra added  more
gently 

there  there  i do not wish to be always scolding  only to make my
little wife more like other women  people are happier when they are like
to those about them  isnt it so  granny  and sometimes i have a fear
that my polly is not as happy with us as i had hoped to make her  eh 
child 

with a hand under her chin  he lifted her face till their eyes met  she
returned his look  long and steadily  but she did not speak  he let her
go  with a deep sigh 

i had thought the child would loosen her tongue by this  he spoke as
if she were not present  but no matter  too little speech in a wife is
better than too much  they say 

she is a still woman  ezra  said granny  some are born so  it does
not mean that they are always sad women  she added in a low voice to
polly  as the girl passed  speak to him  child  you will not let your
man go into the wilderness without a word 

polly went to her husband obediently  and said with a sudden effort 
stay 

                                                    

he turned and caught her in his arms  his face radiant 

why  my pretty  why my own dear  you do not want me to leave you  then 
yet it was you who bade me go  and so i passed my word  and neighbor
cook is waiting to ride on with me  and i have told others that i would
surely be at the meeting of court in harrodsburg  to tell the truth  i
thought our son might be proud  some day  to know that his father was
one of those to bring the law into kentucky 

it will not be for long  polly only a matter of a week or two  but tis
the longest and farthest we have been separated since i found you  which
makes it hard both 

he kissed her hungrily  kisses which  after a moment of passivity  she
returned  almost with violence  granny knitted obliviously  smiling to
herself  he put his wife from him at last with an effort  muttering 

i  must  go now  or  i cannot     eh  well  black ben shall sleep in
the lean to each night i am gone  and tis many a day since the savages
ventured close to a settlement  thank god  you will be safe  at least 
you are  not  afraid 

polly shook her head 

of course not  he laughed shortly  you who have known so much worse
than loneliness  remember there are neighbors within gunshot  and you
have granny for company  granny and our son  polly  he was eying her
closely  and asked again  you are not afraid 

dont you see  suggested granny  tis you she fears for  son  you
going  out alone into the wilderness  ah  tis the hardest thing a woman
has to bear  the waiting 

                                                    

but things are not as they were in your waiting days  granny  he said
gently  the wilderness has shrunk away from us  back to beyond the ohio
water  there are cabins and farms and settlements now  all along the
road to harrodsburg  and one or two houses as fine as any in virginia 

you do not pass at all through indian country  she questioned 

there is no indian country  he answered  with pride  not in all
kentucky  tis ours at last  thanks to you and my own parents and others
who paid the price 

ay  paid the price for something they never got  muttered the old
woman  bitterly  no matter  if only their children get it  but tis
time indeed the law came into kentucky  many a stranger lays claim to
his acres here who neither earned nor bought them 

and thats why im reading law by firelight  me and many others  no
smug liar with a warrant in his hand is going to take from me the land
that is mine by right of conquest  ours is the prior claim here  granny
estill 

ay  ours is the prior claim  unless  she murmured  twere the red
mens  maybe  do e think 

stuff and nonsense  what put that thought into your head  the cherokees
and the iroquois have no real rights here  theyve used the land merely 
enjoyed it  free of cost  and for long enough  theyve not earned it as
we have  bought it with their blood and their sweat  watered it with
their womens tears  enriched it with the blood of their children  such
little precious bodies as this of ours   he stopped by the cradle 
gazing down  his natural orators voice sinking to an abrupt pause 

eh  have they not  asked granny  innocently  it seems that the red
folk may have suffered somewhat  too 

ezra glanced at her uncomfortably  youre old  and the old get queer
notions  the savages have suffered no more than they deserve to suffer 
as none should know better  surely  than mistress estill 

the old womans head drooped over her knitting  i have no love for the
indians  god knows  daily i pray that they may all be damned  but  her
voice altered admiringly  tis you will make the grand lawyer  ezra 
and im not one to be holding up mere facts to argufy against you  i
expect youll be making a speech before them all at the court meeting 

several  if they should ask me  admitted ezra  modestly  but i must
be off  theres bread in the wallet  what  cake  too  good soul  and tow
for cleaning the gun barrels  yes  yes  you forget nothing a traveler
may need  you learned in a good school  eh  granny  wheres my polly
gone 

                                                    

during this talk the girl had stood quite still  listening with apparent
stolidity  but her face was not stolid  at the old womans slight plea
for the indians  it lighted up passionately  only to sink again into the
lines of settled sadness  pollys face at the moment was older than
granny estills  she left the room 

shes gone to get you a travelers gift  explained granny  be sure
you make over it  son  women can do with a lot of praising 

the young man came over to her and spoke low and rapidly 

granny  get her to talk while im gone  will you  ive been thinking
she might open her heart to another woman  easier than to me  thats why
i sent for you to come  has she spoken at all  of those missing years  i
mean 

neither of them nor of aught else  except now and then a sentence  more
like a word or two  tis as if  being among the savages so long  she had
forgotten the use of her native tongue 

she was in the tribe of gray eagle  who speaks english well  confound
him  still  indians are by nature a silent folk  even the squaws do not
chatter  but  granny  tis worse than dumbness  listen  many a time ive
come in from the fields at sundown and found her with nothing done  no
food prepared  the wheel idle  sitting here on the doorstep  gazing 
just gazing  other times she was not to be found  high or low  had gone
off somewhere into the woods  and would not come to my calling  more
than once shes been away well into the night  and me searching till the
hair stood up on my head with fear of what i should find  shes
brooding  or bewitched  i tell you  ive been sick with the worry of it 
fearing there might be summat wrong here  he touched his forehead  now
and then women with child are took that way  im told 

 illustration  they found her paddling the stream  her kirtle tucked up
to her bare knees  

granny nodded 

but they get over it when the child comes  dont they  and she
hasnt  she hasnt  the past few days  since the christening here  its
been worse  lying awake at my side half the night  like one listening
for something  ah  my poor lass  who knows what happened to her there
among those vile creatures  the years before we found her  who knows
what terrible  bitter memories she is holding in her young heart  with
none to help  granny   you  must help her  shes got to speak it all
out  and so get rid of it 

the old woman rose and put her hands on his shoulders 

there  there  boy  dont fash yourself  just shut your eyes and love
her  perhaps the child knows better than us  it may be there are things
of which it is better not to speak  more especially to the man youve
married  two to brood then  instead of one  give her time  ezra  shes
but a girl  things pass  the christening was a mistake  perhaps  so
soon  too many people watching her  looking to see how she behaved after
living among red savages  whispering about her  as neighbors will 
thats why i advised you to take her out of the settlement and win her
back to civilized ways alone  with the things she knows best to
help  woods and water and the open places  it may be i was wrong there 
perhaps they only remind her  well  well  she has her baby now  and
theres nothing to tame a girl like her babies  be patient 

but do you help us if you can  out of your wisdom  he urged 

                                                    

granny blushed  my wisdom  is it  think shame how you mock an ignorant
backwoods woman thats never had the time nor the chance for a word of
it 

im not talking about learning  he said  earnestly  though when it
comes to that  youve got more real learning out of life than ill ever
get out of all the books in richmond town  ssh  here she comes 

polly re entered from the lean to with a pair of white  new moccasins in
her hand  she offered them to ezra  still without speaking 

 illustration  polly came in from the lean to with a pair of fine  new
moccasins in her hand  she offered them to ezra  still without
speaking  

what  these for me  he spoke gruffly  being moved  where did you get
them  thereve been no indian traders around lately  eh  you didnt
 make  them 

polly nodded shyly  smiling for the first time 

why  how fine they are  all the beading and the stitchery and the soft
doeskin  i declare  they might have been made by a squaw 

again granny hushed him with a quick gesture  and ezra bit his lip 

well  i  must  be off  at this rate twill be dusk before i leave  and
i meant to reach cooks before moonrise  we make an early start  he
laid the moccasins on a shelf 

polly watched him wistfully  you  you will not take them 

ezra laughed  no  no  theyre too fine for this journey  the old ones
are good enough  ill save them for special occasions  more
christenings  perhaps  he laughed again  slyly  kissed her close  and
went out of the door with a backward wave of the hand 

granny hobbled to the threshold and watched him over pollys shoulder 

there  hes turned to wave again  what a foolish  loving  dear lad it
is  answer him  girl  quick  you might never see him more  she checked
herself  whatever am i croaking about  such days are gone 

polly waved a listless hand  closed the door  looked a moment at the
moccasins on the shelf  and seated herself at the spinning wheel 

now youve shut the door  and shut out all the light with it  granny
said rather testily  tis nearly dark  and candles are skeerce 
besides  the sunsets pretty  i like to watch it  let the door stay
open 

too pretty  it hurts  said the girl very low  her hand at her breast 

granny looked at her curiously 

humph  youre over young to be having a sunset hurt you  my dear 

polly  at the spinning wheel  was having rather poor success  the thread
broke 

here  let me show you  granny spoke impatiently  steady  no
jerking  why  have you forgotten  everything  your poor mother taught
you before the savages got her  poor annie  a fool woman  but a fine
hand at the spinning and weaving  eh  whats this  tears  ive not seen
you cry before  she gathered the girls head against her breast  her
voice softening  there  there  was it because i spoke of your mother 
and that terrible time  you were so young  i thought maybe you didnt
remember  polly   do  you remember 

polly shook her head  uncertainly 

then  what is wrong  come  my dearie  tell it out  my lamb  thats what
grannies are for  taint much they havent come to understand    

polly said  in a very low voice  the moccasins  

granny laughed aloud  relieved but sympathetic 

is that all  because he didnt wear em  you mean  didnt seem to
appreciate them  lord love you  thats a man all over  he didnt
realize  pet  he didnt know you wanted him to show off well before all
those men at the court meeting  but he appreciated the moccasins just
the same  appreciated most of all the love you put into em  polly  it
 was  love you put into em  want it 

the girl paused a moment before answering  slowly  i do not know  he is
kind  beautiful     it might be  if  if    

if  repeated granny  if  then in heavens name  why aint it  

the girl gave her a queer  beseeching look  and did not answer 

eh  well  sighed the old woman  tis your own business  sure  reckon
im getting to be a right meddlesome old fool 

                                                    

she resumed her knitting  the spinning wheel whirred again  the room
grew darker  would have been quite dark except for a flickering light
from the pine knot on the hearth  grannys voice came presently out of
the shadows  with a dreamy quality unusual to its brisk accents 

that smell of burning pinewood always makes me think of the forest  and
of our first little cabin there in the clearing  mine and danls  a
happy time    

the girl at the spinning wheel lifted her head with a sharp movement  as
of pain  which was not lost on the old eyes watching her 

tell me  dearie  ive often wanted to ask  were they so terribly cruel
to you  those ugly savages  granny asked quietly 

they were not all cruel  the girl said  nor ugly 

no  repeated the other  encouraged  not the women  perhaps  one of
them would have mothered you  i dessay  surely even red savage women
would want to protect a poor little motherless thing like you  just
coming into womanhood  and  and save her from the wickedness of the
men 

the men  said polly  were not all wicked 

granny winced  but she spoke again  very gently  sometimes cruelty from
men is  is better than too much kindness  eh  polly  my girl 

there was no answer  the spinning wheel whirred unevenly 

granny sighed  of course you neednt talk to me unless youve a mind
to  only  remember  if youve got something to forget  that aint the
way to do it  keeping it all to yourself  that aint the way to do it 

after a pause she spoke again  haltingly 

sometimes ive thought  maybe its because im old  getting into my
dotage  but ive thought there might be things you  didnt want to
forget   i know how it takes ahold of men  that wild  free life  it sort
of spoils em for houses and folks and duties  and such as that  they
keep wanderin off  further and further off  till some day they dont
never come back  my danl  your own grandfather  was like that  but
women are different  polly  theyve got to be  theyve got to mind the
house  and see that the fire dont go out  see that the courage dont go
out in their men folk  either  because it takes more than tinder to
light that again  else there soon wouldnt be any homes to mind  all of
us wanderin round loose in herds  like the wild beasts  sometimes 
since we got you back  polly  ive been scared you might have inherited
a sort of hankerin for the wilderness  from your grandfather 
dearie    

the girl had stopped spinning  she slipped over to the cradle and
crouched beside it  whispering in a sort of moan   nenemoosha 
nenemoosha     

ah  was he stirring in his sleep  and his deaf old granny never heard 
takes a mothers ear for that  but you oughtnt to talk to him in that
outlandish tongue  i declare you oughtnt   nenemoosha   what a name
for a boy thats just been christened a good  sound bible john 
whatever does it mean 

it means beloved  answered the girl  very low 

                                                    

oh  just a pet name  said the other  mollified  and a right pretty
one  too  is it hungry  then  poor little starved lamb  she added  for
the baby was whimpering urgently 

the mother ran into the lean to and returned after a moment  bringing an
old fashioned nursing bottle with a long rubber tube  which granny eyed
with great disfavor 

humph  what a contraption to cheat a child out of its natural rights 
dont see many of em in these parts  cook must a got it from a french
trader  all well enough for his poor wean  whose mother died in the
borning  but for a strong  hearty lass like you     im surprised he
would a brought it to you  dont seem quite modest  like 

i asked him for it  said polly 

asked him  whatever for 

the girl answered  hesitatingly  if  if i should be taken away  like
young mistress cook    

nonsense  interrupted granny  briskly  none of that  my girl  no
silly thoughts  youre peaked  to be sure  but taint as if you coughed 
nor run a low fever  nor looked to be sickening up for something  youll
live to see the little tad followin at your heels like a puppy  and
another of him lying in the cradle  thats right  she went on  as polly
dropped to her knees beside the baby  and bent low over him  her face
hidden  thats the place to forget whats troubling you  there with him
at your breast  no more foolish fancies  and no more wandering for wife
and mother of men like ours  polly  my darling  theyll do the
wandering  with us to come back to in their own good time  tis a fine 
thrilling life out there in the wilderness  but tis a happier one  here
under our own apple trees at home  eh 

the room was growing quite dark 

better put a fagot on  added the old woman  never neglect your fire 
child  tis bad housekeeping  and then come here  i want to talk to
you  polly crouched obediently at her knee  turning up a face full of
trust and love 

no  not like that  said the other sharply  sit like a civilized body 
do  not squatting on your haunches like one of them squaw critters 
there  thats better  sometimes you give me a turn  with your savage
ways  polly  do e know why ive come out to live with you and young
ezra here  me thats got a good home of her own  and had thought to be
done forever with the border life  you see  i kind of lost my courage 
that time the savages got your pa and ma  and took you captive  not that
i hadnt plenty of other children left  but johnny  your father  was my
first  danls boy  and nobody has their first but once 

it went sort of hard with me  dearie  i heard it all  you see  though i
want in it  johnny having put me under the floor at the first
yell  always taking such care of his mother  that boy  i heard poor
annie shrieking as they killed the other children  she was always sort
of pore sperrited  i heard your father strugglin and cussin every foot
of the way as they drug him out to the bonfire in the yard  a very
cussin man was john  and he wanted to make them mad enough to kill him
and be done with it  but they wouldnt  and then  at the last  i heard
him singing 

                                                    

the old woman was trembling violently  and polly stared at her 

 singing   she repeated 

ay  cant you remember  cant you remember even that  id like you to
remember that  but maybe theyd carried you out of hearing  i couldnt
stand it any more  i had to see what they were doing to my boy  so i
crept along under the floor till i found a chink in the logs i could
peep out of  they had him marching round and round a stake  with the
fire licking at him already  and this was the song he sang  grannys
face was lifted  with eyes closed  like some old sibyls  and she raised
a quavering voice to the tune of wearing of the green  

    oh  you who are in hiding 
    lie low just where you be 
    and dont you stir or whisper
    no matter what befalls 

he was warning me  you see  she whispered  still taking care of his
mammy  and him with the flames licking his body  and them he loved lying
dead at his feet    

her voice died away  and polly reached up a hand to stroke her cheek 
her breast 

my father  she murmured proudly  that was my father 
but  quickly  gray eagle was not there  he was not chief then  he
never tortures  only kills  she added quickly 

killins bad enough  said granny grimly  when it happens to them you
love  wait and see  she paused suddenly  her face tense  queer  to
hear turkeys gobbling in the corn this time of year  i must have
imagined it  talking about indians  they used to make sounds like that 
or like whippoorwills  

at that moment the note of a whippoorwill sounded  distinct and clear 
granny pulled herself together  with a short laugh 

                                                    

i declare im getting as timid and notional as town folks  scaring
myself with my own tales  well  polly  i started to tell you why ive
come out again to the sort of place i never expected to see more 
twant to help you when the baby borned  plenty of neighbor women to
do that  nowadays  twas because  i didnt like what i was hearin about
my granddaughter  johnnys girl  it didnt seem to me you was doin us
credit  always mopin and pindlin around  humoring yourself 

why  polly  my child  dont you know tis a wifes first duty to go
cheerful about her house  even if she dont feel to be cheerful inside 
and why you shouldnt feel to be cheerful beats me 

polly laid her cheek against her grandmothers knee  a caressing 
disarming gesture that was very sweet 

listen  said granny  more gently  i got to confess something  when
simon kenton come and told me he was making up a party of our boys to go
and rescue a blue eyed child hed seen in a tepee over in the ohio
country  polly  i prayed  it want you  i did so  manys the hour id
spent on my knees  asking god to see that you was dead  thanking him for
taking your parents before they knew what had come to you  you so pretty
and tender  just coming into womanhood  and when runners come in ahead
to say it really was you theyd found and were fetching back  i says to
myself  to what  what is there in life for a girl whos been the  the
plaything of savage brutes  what decent man would marry her after this 
and let her mother his children  ah  id seen captives brought back
before  and i knew what it meant 

but simon kenton made me ashamed of those black thoughts  he told me
that out here in the wild places men had come to realize that purity is
something which comes from within  not without  that a womans honor
couldnt possibly be harmed by anybody or anything  except herself  and
then he told me that one of the finest young men in his company had
already bespoke your hand  eh  that was a wonderful hearing  a brave and
beautiful hearing 

polly sprang erect  and spoke proudly 

but i did not wish to be married to one of his young men 

 illustration  polly sprang to her feet and spoke proudly  but i did
not wish to be married to one of his young men  

no  poor child  said the other  with great gentleness  twas a
feeling that did you credit  as all thought  but since ezra todd was
willing to take the chance  you see the importance of getting you
married  and quickly  too  a fine  upstanding fellow  ezra  look what
hes done already  cleared his land  planted it to corn and orchard 
bought you a good stout nigger to do the work many a housewife has to do
for herself  built this comfortable cabin  given you clothes such as any
town lady might envy  ah  polly  have you no gratitude 

yes  said the girl 

well  i should hope so  and what a wedding it was  the liveliest i ever
saw  though ive seen a plenty of gay ones  had a few myself  for that
matter  neighbors riding in from miles about  simon kenton and all his
hunters to help with the roof raising  master boone himself come to do
honor to my grandchild  for dan boone knows well what it is to lose a
girl to the savages  and get her again  such dancing and eating and
drinking  and courting  i vow there wasnt a sober man in our
neighborhood for the whole week  and even some of the women 

she chuckled reminiscently  twas more than just a wedding  you see 
twas a public rejoicing  a real triumph  for everyone  it seemed like 
except the bride  not that people didnt understand  my dearie  more
than one said to me  poor maid  shes mazed yet with her own good
fortune  thinking on the horrors shes escaped  but now  the old voice
grew stern  they dont understand  ezra himself  your husband  dont
understand     polly  are you listening to me 

                                                    

the girl was alert  rigid  her eyes fixed on the window  she lifted a
cautious hand 

ssh  there  something moves outside 

granny rose vigorously  though with the aid of her cane  and went to the
window 

whos there  she demanded  oh  you  black ben  what are you doing
tiptoeing around  startling people  didnt the master tell you to stay
in the lean to after dark  until he gets back 

a voice spoke from without 

yaism  ole miss  i lowed id better slip down to de pound to see
whaffor de cattle makin such a to do  ack like dey skeert o suthin 

dearie me  said granny  i hope it isnt a wildcat  i doubt if i could
kill one of the critters nowadays  she laughed  did i ever tell you
about the time i killed a wildcat  polly  a real painter 

she paused as she passed the chimney shelf  noticing something on it
which she picked up to examine 

why  tis an eagles feather  a gray one  its some time since ive
seen an eagle near the settlements  they seem to be passing with the
indians  whered it come from  do you reckon 

i found it  replied the girl  slowly  on our doorstep  two days ago 

                                                    

on our step  well  well  after the chickens  of course  but it comes
close  i must tell ben to watch for it  hes a good shot  for a nigger 
well  about my wildcat  child  get your knitting  a good housewife never
sits idle  we wont need lights for that  i dont hold with this
newfangled way of lighting a dip as soon as youd say jack robinson 
rank wastefulness  i call it  get you a stool and sit beside me  no 
closer  i like to be able to touch your pretty hair now and then  just
to be sure youre here  for so long  you werent 

the girl seated herself between granny and the cradle  facing the
window  toward which the others shoulder was turned 

tis a long story  began the old woman  but then all of mine are
that  youre patient with a garrulous old tongue  dearie  it happened
afore we come over the mountains  danl and me  your real grandfather 
you know  the first of my husbands  he was away at the time  he was
mostly away  being that sort  and i had your father johnny in the
cradle  and another coming  as usual  when one evening toward dusk  like
now  i heard a commotion in the hen yard  i seized my musket and run
out  and there in the midst of the fowl crouched a wildcat  i outs with
a screech and ups with my gun  not having time to take aim  and then i
started to the cabin at a run  the critter after me  it was a race for
life  and i reckon the painterd have won it  his first leap landed so
close that his claws tore my petticoat  but out of the door comes our
old hound jinny  rampaging  she having a litter of pups under my bed at
the time and fierce as a lion with it  and the painter got her instead
of me  laying her wide open with one rip  i was so mad about poor old
jinny that i forgot how scared i was  and turned and busted that cats
head in with the butt of the gun  i did so 

polly seemed to be listening  tensely 

you do well to hearken to me brag  said granny  with a placid chuckle 
for i was certainly as brave as you make em  those days  like jinny
with her litter of pups  when danl come back he was proud of me  said
it want no use wasting a gun on a woman of my ability  all i needed
was a broom handle 

 illustration  slowly a head appeared above the window ledge  an indian
head  crowned with feathers  polly stared at it as if paralyzed  

slowly  while she spoke  a head had appeared above the window ledge  an
indian head  crowned with feathers  polly stared at it as if paralyzed 
the indian returned her gaze  gave a swift glance about the room  made a
slight movement of the head backward  and disappeared  pollys hand
reached back to clutch convulsively at the cradle  she spoke
breathlessly  haltingly 

and now  the time my daniel grandfather disappeared  tell about that 

 illustration  the indian returned the girls gaze  then glanced swiftly
about the room  

granny sighed deeply  what  another tale  eh  well  it is your story 
too  danl had always the wanderfoot  he was a great one for wanting to
see the far side of things  hed urge and beg me to go along  but how
could i  me with small children  we quarreled about it a good deal  but
i always said to him  for that sort must never be apron tied  i said 
you go first  and if its so grand over there as you think  come back
one of these days in your coach and four and fetch your family  again
and again hed get so mad hed take me at my word  only to come slipping
meekly home after a week or a month  or maybe two of them  because he
loved me  you see  for all my quarrelin ways 

yes  and you him  queried the girl  softly 

eh  child  better than you know  better than i knew myself  perhaps 

better than  your children  whispered polly 

                                                    

grannys head drooped  im afraid so  women cant help their feelings 
even when they do their duty  or what seems to them such  once  he was
gone so long that folks said he want coming back  a hunter told me he
was dead  that hed seen danls curly red scalp drying at the door of
an indian tepee  and so he had  only some folks are tough enough to
outlive even a scalping  they pestered me to be marrying again  they
would not let me be  a woman has no chance to mourn her dead in peace in
this country  were too skeerce  so i promised at last to marry the man
that wanted me worst  but on the day set for the wedding  what should i
hear but a musket shot  in the woods beyond my clearing  a musket whose
voice i knew well  it was my danls betsey gun 

ah h  polly took the corner of her apron  and wiped the old womans
eyes 

eh  was i crying  i didnt know  well  the time come when danl really
was gone  for good and all  i couldnt believe it at first  though since
hed lost his scalp he was always off hunting for it  had got sort of
queer like  two  three years i waited  the men pestering me nigh out of
my wits  for i was a comely wench then  and a good cook  too  and at
last i married the poor soul id had to disappoint before  after his
death  he died in his bed  for a wonder  i took me another  and come on
over the mountains with him  hunting for danl  i do believe  though i
wouldnt have told it to myself  and when the indians got that one  i
wedded my fourth  all good men and true  they were  who gave me their
love  and my children  and something to do for  you know  but
still  the old voice sank to a whisper  manys the night i lay awake
beside the man i was married to at the time  with his baby asleep in the
crook of my arm  listening  listening for the sound of danls
betsey gun  

and if you had heard it  demanded the girl  with strange eagerness 

ah  the old woman made a wide gesture of surrender  if i had heard
it  i should have risen up out of that bed  mother to many that i
was  ay  and grandmother  too  and i should have gone to him  gone to
the love of my youth  my danl  for i knew by then that he was my
man  he and no other  a woman belongs to the one mate only  no matter
how many take her after    

yes  polly had risen to her feet  her face alight  a woman belongs
to the one mate only  she repeated  now i will tell you  now you will
understand  grandmother  they took me from my mate  only one moon we had
together  and they took me away  i tried to tell them  but they would
not listen  they thought me crazed  i tried to hide from them  but they
found me  i tried to slip away and go to him  but they brought me back 
and now they have given me to another  and tell me i must forget  how
can i forget  what right have i to forget  you think that my man
forgets  no  it would not be hard to love this other one  he is young 
kind  handsome  but indians do not mate often  like palefaces  to them
that is shame  the moon looks at me sternly  so that i cannot sleep  the
forest calls to me and i cannot go  when there is rain on this strange
roof i close my eyes and think it is beating upon our tepee beyond the
water  but i have not known where i shall find him again  nor how 

granny was gasping  my girl  my girl  light the candle  quick  i cannot
see you  what are you telling me  a red man  a savage  the murderer of
your own people  you would bring such disgrace as this on decent folk 
but no  no  you are mad  my poor lamb  ezra was right  the horror has
turned your wits  there  there  my pretty  we will protect you  ezra
will not let them take you again  and the baby will comfort and
heal    

a sudden cry of terror from without drowned her speech  a savage yell 
the negros voice panting as he neared the cabin 

injuns  injuns  lemme in  miss  open de do  fo gawds sake  lemme
 in   aie e e  a shriek died into silence 

again the savage yell  much closer 

granny was already out of her chair  stick and rheumatism forgotten  and
across the cabin with the agility of a cat 

the bars  quick  she panted  as she ran  get those bars across the
door  ill take care of the window  she slammed the shutter as she
spoke  now the door to the lean to  come  help me push the table
against it  now the settle  so  she was everywhere at once  cap off 
gray hair flying  dont stand there  gaping  here  take a shot through
the shutter chink  even if you hit nothing  itll bring help 

she herself was sighting carefully at one of the door portholes  there
was a loud report  a choking grunt 

there  she said grimly  i got him  theyre in the lean to  theyll be
on the roof next  um  i thought so  she listened a moment  her eyes
lifted  then darted to the bed  seized a pillow  slashed it open with
the bread knife  and dumped the contents on the flames  a burst of smoke
set them coughing  aha  she muttered  you would  would you  im onto
your tricks  nasty devils  youll not get in the chimney way  so long as
the feathers last  shoot  girl  shoot  i tell you  let em think weve
men in here  well stand them off till the neighbors come 

                                                    

she was reloading her flintlock with deft and steady hands  the girl 
who had hitherto obeyed instructions like one dazed  stood irresolute in
the center of the room  gazing from door to cradle  and back again  a
tomahawk struck the door  came halfway through  and stuck  quivering 

theyre too many of em  theyll get in  groaned granny  shaking her
fist at it  but dont give up   whatever happens to me   you hear  i
can delay them awhile  maybe  you take the bread knife and fight for
your life  polly todd  for more than your life  remember  laugh  scream
like one crazed  they spare mad folk sometimes  fight em off tooth and
nail  till help comes  remember why  your husband  the child    

step by step  polly had moved toward the door  over her shoulder she
watched the old woman  who was at the window  her back turned  sighting
for another shot  her lip was drawn up so that the teeth showed  she
shivered  slid the bars  and opened the door  indians slipped past her
and leaped upon the old woman  polly screamed 

no  grandmother   look out   no 

the last of the indians to enter was a tall young chieftain  wearing a
bonnet of gray eagles feathers  he lifted his hand with a gesture of
quiet dignity  and spoke slowly and gravely 

we know of old this white woman  her years and courage  do not fear for
her 

                                                    

he faced polly in silence  a stately  splendid young creature in blanket
and loin cloth  painted as to face and body  but not for war  his was
the regalia of a bridegroom  the girl sat by the cradle in an attitude
of complete submission  hands folded  head bowed 

meanwhile granny battled desperately with the indians who held her 
grinning  they bound her hands behind her  forced her down upon a stool 
tying her feet to its legs  but never hurting her 

she did not cease for a moment her maledictions  you vile devils  you
thieves  you murderers  wait til my grandson catches you  steal what
you can find  theres food  gear  money  but let you lay so much as a
finger on that girl or her child  and hell get you if he has to go to
hell for you  ezra  she screamed suddenly  help  help  take your dirty
hand out of my mouth  you fiend  youll not stop me yelling until you
kill me  ezra ah h 

they gagged her with her own knitting  but still she strained at her
thongs  spluttering  glaring  cursing them with her fierce eyes  the
indians laughed among themselves  one said  old long knife squaw heap
big fighting brave  ugh 

they began to run about rapidly  picking up everything in sight  always
with a cautious eye on gray eagle  however  one tied an apron around his
waist  so that it hung down behind  one spied the moccasins polly had
sewed for ezra  and appropriated them with a grunt of satisfaction 
another seized the bread knife  and made a pass with it at the old
woman  who did not wince 

the chieftain spoke at last  gravely 

the moon maid has waited for me 

ah  too long  whispered polly 

he smiled  that is well  the eagle bides his time  he has no desire to
strike  only to take in peace what is his  come  then 

he turned to the door  and the girl followed  granny strained forward 
glaring terribly  struggling to be heard  but the girl did not look at
her  then from the cradle came a faint  thin wail 

polly started  like one waking from a trance  and rushed back to the
cradle  the indian followed  hearing him  she turned at bay  both arms
stretched backward over the cradle as if in protection  he put her
aside  and leaned over to look  frowning 

ho  he muttered  a man child  the moonmaids son 

she nodded  fearfully 

a white child  he said  still gazing  and too young  it is not mine 
the moon maid has lied 

his hand went to the tomahawk at his belt 

polly cried out  sank to her knees  her arms embracing his legs 

no   no   listen  the baby is mine  mine  but you did not come  they
were my people  what was i to do  i but one and they so many  in my
heart i waited  granny  granny  tell him    

                                                    

the indian looked down at her  his face slowly relaxing  he turned to
the door again  saying  come 

polly  with a gasp of relief  bent quickly to pick up the child  but he
stopped her with a stern gesture 

no  it is not my son  gray eagle is no thief 

she moaned  you mean  i am to leave him  but how can i  how can i  not
yet  he will be hungry  her two hands went with a piteous gesture to
her breasts 

gray eagle said  choose 

he stalked to the door and out  the other indians followed  polly stared
after them  wringing her hands  whimpering like an animal  she met the
intent gaze of her grandmother fixed upon her 

what shall i do  what shall i  do   you tell me  i knew it would be so 
he will not come again  unless  to kill  and how shall i find him  how
shall i ever go to him  yet my baby  my little son  

slowly  stiffly  the old womans head turned until her eyes indicated
the door through which the indian had gone  polly covered her face with
her arms  you mean  i am to go  you tell me that  she went to the old
woman  stroking the wrinkled cheeks  the hands  desperately  it is
good by  then  ezra  you will make him understand  remind him of what he
said about the prior claim  tell him  tell him i would have stayed 
perhaps  if i could    

without another glance at the cradle  she ran out  the old womans eyes
closed  as if in unbearable pain  then they opened again  suddenly  for
polly was back 

i cannot  i  cannot   she whimpered  running to the cradle  she lifted
the baby  rolled it close in a blanket as if to hide it  and ran out 
holding it close 

granny strained forward  listening intently  then after a moment came a
wild wail 

no  no  you shall not  give him to me   give  him  he is mine  i beg  i
 beg  you not      nenemoosha  nenemoosha     

the old womans eyes almost started out of their sockets  two great
tears burst from them  and then the door opened and gray eagle
re entered  carrying the rolled blanket  he laid it in the cradle
without comment  and went out  closing the door behind him 

presently there came a distant sound that made mistress estill shrink
and quiver  the triumphant scalp halloo of the iroquois  receding 

then silence reigned  there was no sound from the cradle  granny had
long ceased to struggle  the candle guttered and went out  the embers on
the hearth died into blackness  night passed 

                                                    

with the first faint gray of dawn  galloping hoofs approached  then the
voice of ezra todd was to be heard calling strongly  polly  polly  my
wife  i am here  coming  a short  sharp cry  and ezra appeared in the
doorway  grasping at the sides of it like one spent 

 illustration  ezra appeared in the doorway  grasping the side as if
spent  dark in here  dark  he muttered  polly  are you here  

dark in here  dark  he muttered  i must make a light  oh  my god  i
dare not  polly   polly   are you here  his voice rose to a cry  then
steadied itself  what chance  with the negro dead  and an indian body
in the yard  they were in haste  to have left that  oh  damn them  he
was moving about like a drunken man  feeling for the candle  granny made
a slight sound  he started violently  whats that  not all dead  oh 
quick  quick  his shaking hand managed at last to strike a spark from
the tinder box  the candle flared  he leaped toward the old woman 

ah h  only you  what have they done with her  where is my wife  but you
cant speak yet  of course not  patience  man  patience  thus exhorting
himself  he removed the gag  loosened her  brought water  liquor  all in
a terrible  clumsy haste  muttering as he worked 

they told me at cooks that indian canoes had been seen  i turned back 
rode all night  the mares foundered  but too late  ben killed  polly
gone  where  where  ah  now you can speak  quick  woman 

granny struggled for her voice  perhaps she was also struggling for time
to collect her wits 

come  come  in mercys name  groaned ezra  tell me at least if they
got polly 

granny nodded  gulping 

and the child  they took the baby  too 

granny shook her head  pointing a tremulous hand toward the cradle at
which she did not look 

so  they separated my poor lass from her child  the hell hounds  and
now  which way  answer me  in hysterical impatience he shook her  tell
me which  way  they went  up or down stream 

the old woman gulped and gurgled unintelligibly  and he sprang away as
if he could bear no more 

if you wont help me  i must go  im sorry for you  i will send
neighbors  but i must go 

granny made a hoarse effort  go  where 

where  in gods name  to find my wife 

no use  croaked granny 

ezra cried out  no use  dont  dont say it  woman  ive not lost my
wits  or my woodcraft  see  im quite steady  he held out a hand that
trembled like a leaf  therell be some trace  well find her  the
neighbors are out  we found her before  we shall again   

no use  granny croaked once more  the tears streamed unheeded down her
cheeks 

it was the tears that made him understand  mistress estill was no
weeping female  he backed from her until he reached a table  and leaned
on it heavily  as if he could no longer stand erect 

you are trying to tell me  that they did not take polly  alive 

granny had found her voice at last  she told her lie with pride 

take polly alive  how should they take her alive  my granddaughter  you
think she would not hold herself too dear for that  your wife  the
mother of your son  she might well have gone with them unharmed  some
women do  more shame to them  but not her  she fought them off  fought
them like any wildcat  take your foul hands from me  she said  for i
belong to the one man only  my husband  dead you may take me if you can 
but living no other man shall have me  never 

the mans head slowly lifted  a strange look came over his ravaged face 
a look almost of relief 

she said that  did she  my polly  my brave  loving  loyal little mate 
i might have known    

the old woman  closely watching him  lied with growing confidence 

and so  seeing they could not get her otherwise  they killed her  son 
killed her clean and swift as a body would want to die  not lingering on
after the heart has gone out of her  beyond her time  but fighting to
the last  like any man  for the things she holds dearer than life  her
home  her child  her  her love    

ezra burst into a terrible sobbing  and the old woman  rising with
infinite difficulty  managed to hobble over to him by the aid of stools
and table  and held his head against her breast  she was whispering
under her breath  god forgive me  god forgive me 

at last he stirred  saying dully  her body  perhaps they will have left
me that   

no  no  said granny in startled haste  not even that  you see  she
had need to think rapidly  they  they dragged polly down to the river 
she struggling every step of the way  calling on your name  cursing
them  no  no  not cursing   what am i thinking of  that was another
child of mine  her father  she passed a distracted hand over her brow 
but  anyway  twas there they had killed her  ezra  because she  she
wouldnt get into the canoe  you see  they could not force her away from
you  ah  a grand fight she made of it  and so they  they did the thing 
and cast her body into the river  tis a swift water  son  shell be far
from this by now  drifting who knows where  who knows where 

                                                    

the mans head fell upon his breast  it did not occur to him to ask
further questions  to wonder how the woman could have seen so much 
bound as she was  and through a closed door 

in the silence that followed  the baby awoke and cried 

god be praised  gasped granny  he is alive then  alive  i have not
dared to ask  or to look  so still he was   

like his mother  said ezra  he went to the cradle and stood gazing 
his face a quiver  suddenly he stooped and took something out of the
babys clenched fist  a long  gray feather  what is this  he asked 
dully 

granny started  the indian  then had left his sign  his warning  but she
managed to answer  carelessly 

oh  that  why  he must have pulled it out of his mothers feather
duster  strong little man that he is  come  ezra  make up the fire  son 
tis time for the childs nursing bottle 

for mistress estill  builder of empire  had little energy left to waste
on grief
